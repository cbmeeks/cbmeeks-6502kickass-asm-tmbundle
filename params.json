I'm also a fan of TextMate and more recently, Sublime Text 2.  Both of which can support the same `bundles`.  These bundles allow syntax highlighting, code snippets and more.\r\n\r\nI forgot where I got this bundle originally but it was based on the 6502 DASM bundle for TextMate.  So I am slowly migrating and tweaking to better support the KickAssembler format.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the amazing [KickAssembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.php) today!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
